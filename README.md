# Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis-Using-Python-

1. üîç Business Problem
In recent years, City Hotels and Resort Hotels have faced significant challenges due to high cancellation rates. These cancellations have impacted their revenue and room utilization. The primary goal of this analysis was to identify the key factors driving cancellations and provide data-driven recommendations to reduce cancellation rates, enhance customer satisfaction, and boost revenue.

2. üìä Key Steps in the Project
Problem Statement Creation:
Defined a clear problem statement to focus the analysis on understanding cancellation behavior and improving hotel efficiency.

3. Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Explored the dataset, handled missing values, and ensured data integrity for accurate insights.

4. Analysis and Visualization:
Conducted in-depth analysis and created visualizations to highlight patterns and trends, including:

Reservation Status: Found that 37% of reservations were canceled, significantly impacting revenue.
City vs. Resort Hotels: City hotels had more bookings, but resort hotels faced higher cancellation rates.
Monthly Trends: August had the highest bookings (including cancellations), while January saw the highest cancellation percentage.
Pricing and Cancellations: Demonstrated a direct correlation between higher average daily rates (ADR) and cancellation rates.
Booking Channels: Identified that 46% of clients booked through online travel agencies, with offline channels being less common.
Country Analysis: Found that Portugal had the highest cancellation rates among all countries.

5. Hypotheses Testing:
Higher prices lead to more cancellations.
Longer waiting lists contribute to cancellations.
Most clients prefer booking via online travel agents.

6. üìà Key Insights
Pricing Impact: Higher prices result in higher cancellations. Adjusting pricing strategies can reduce cancellations.
Monthly Variations: Cancellations spike in January, suggesting a need for targeted campaigns to increase bookings during this period.
Geographic Focus: Portugal emerged as the country with the highest cancellations, indicating the need to enhance services or marketing strategies in this region.
Booking Channels: Online travel agencies dominate, offering a clear area for hotels to optimize partnerships and promotions.
üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations
Flexible Pricing Strategies: Reduce ADR during low seasons or for specific hotel types to minimize cancellations.
Targeted Campaigns: Launch promotions or discounts during months like January to boost bookings and reduce cancellations.
Improve Services in High-Cancellation Areas: Focus on enhancing guest experiences and loyalty programs, particularly in regions like Portugal.
Strengthen Online Travel Agent Relationships: As most bookings come from online platforms, optimizing partnerships with OTAs can lead to better customer engagement and retention.
This project not only helped me enhance my skills in data analysis and visualization but also provided valuable insights into how hotels can make data-driven decisions to improve revenue and operational efficiency.
